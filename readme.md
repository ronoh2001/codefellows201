This is my Readme file!

Sorry, I had to delete and redo the repository, so I don't have all my updates :(

This code was pair programmed with Yunjoo Kim.  She drove while I navigated.


there were two skunks.  one is named 'In' the other is named 'Out'.  In was always outside and Out was always inside. One day Out's mom said to Out,"Out go outside and find In.  I've been looking for In all day long".  Out went outside and immediately came back with In.  Out's mom asked Out, 'Out how did you find In so fast?'.  Out replied, 'In stinks!'
